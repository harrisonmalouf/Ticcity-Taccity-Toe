This is a fun game that I've i've created through HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Purpose

This Tic Tac Toe game was created for the sole purpose for my courses project. While making this game its been a pleasure learning more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. Since this project was built from scratch I personally was able to learn a lot about each one these lanuages. I felt that it was a inspiring process to see something coming together right infront of me when a few weeks ago I hand no understanding on any of these computing concepts or lanuages.

### My Experience

During the process of building this project there was a lot of concepts I needed to wrap my head around, I felt that the logic board was one of the more intersting parts. Understanding the art of if statements and writing code that I could understand as well as others is something that if felt passionate about and made a point of doing so during this project. At this time pseudo code was one of the most important tools for me as it helped me break to concepts of each individual line that was written for present and for future.

My personal highlight was working on the CSS, this was the first time I'd really let loose on trying to make something standout during the course and had a theme in mind. It was important to me not to over do it with animations, it was an exciting time during this part of my course as I'd just been inundated with CSS libraries and inspiring talks about innovative ways to apply CSS in ones project.

### Future

- I'd love to make stemming from this project a tic tac toe with rock paper scissors elements. I would of loved to do it for this project, however I didn't have enough time. As I've recently finished my course I intend to come back and visit this idea.

- Implement a score system instead of just refreshing the page, this would provide some level of replayability which I feel is important to any game.

### Special Thanks

This project would of never made it as far as it did without the help and support of everyone within sei33. I felt inspired to push myself as hard as I could from working together with everyone in the first weeks of my course. That being said, there are some specific people I'd like to thank for the patience and dedication to helping me understand key concepts in building my Tic Tac Toe.

- **Joel Turnbull; Teacher**, it goes without saying he's an incredible teacher who's quick to understand what I'm asking so that I don't have to spend hours slaving over the internet to figure out why my code is bugged.

- **Rashida Bengali; Teacher Assistant**, at most stages through this project when I wasn't understanding a concept or a bug she was my go to for help. Her patience and dedication to helping me learn and create this project was paramount to my success.

### Bugs

There are a few minor bugs that are still lurking around.

- The resizing of the background image as my victory message pops up.

- An animation for my victory message doesn't have a smooth animation.

- The winner changes if you continue to play. An example would be if player X wins, then if O continues and reaches a winning condition
