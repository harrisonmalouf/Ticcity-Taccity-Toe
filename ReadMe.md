# Ticcity Taccity Toe

This is a fun game that I've i've created through HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Bugs

There are a few minor bugs that are still lurking around.

- The resizing of the background image as my victory message pops up.

- An animation for my victory message doesn't have a smooth animation.

- The winner changes if you continue to play. An example would be if player X wins, then if O continues and reaches a winning condition

### Purpose

This Tic Tac Toe game was created for the sole purpose for my courses project. While making this game its been a pleasure learning more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. This website has been built from scratch.

### Future

- I'd love to make stemming from this project a tic tac toe with rock paper scissors elements. I would of loved to do it for this project, however I didn't have enough time.

- Implement a score system instead of just refreshing the page.
