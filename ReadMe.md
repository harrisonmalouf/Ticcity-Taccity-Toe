This is a fun game that I've i've created through HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Bugs

There are a few minor bugs that are still lurking around.

- The resizing of the background image as my victory message pops up.

- An animation for my victory message doesn't have a smooth animation.

- The winner changes if you continue to play. An example would be if player X wins, then if O continues and reaches a winning condition

### Purpose

This Tic Tac Toe game was created for the sole purpose for my courses project. While making this game its been a pleasure learning more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. This website has been built from scratch.

### Future

- I'd love to make stemming from this project a tic tac toe with rock paper scissors elements. I would of loved to do it for this project, however I didn't have enough time.

- Implement a score system instead of just refreshing the page.

### Special Thanks

This project would of never made it as far as it did without the help and support of everyone within sei33. I felt inspired to push myself as hard as I could from working together with everyone in the first weeks of my course. That being said, there are some specific people I'd like to thank for the patience and dedication to helping me understand key concepts in building my Tic Tac Toe.

- **Joel Turnbull; Teacher**, it goes without saying he's an incredible teacher who's quick to understand what I'm asking so that I don't have to spend hours slaving over the internet to figure out why my code is bugged.

- **Rashida Bengali; Teacher Assistant**, at most stages through this project when I wasn't understanding a concept or a bug she was my go to for help. Her patience and dedication to helping me learn and create this project was paramount to my success.
